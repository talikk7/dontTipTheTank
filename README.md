# dontTipTheTank

This is a term project for a class, Information Visualization (CS458) at Oregon State University

This is a pygame program to study One Point Perspective in a 2D game.
Ideally, the character will look like it is moving father away if we render a smaller image the further away the character moves.

The Premise of this game is that you are a fish out of water.
To make sure that you dont die out of water, you need to pick up blocks.
Over time, you health will decrease.

Its a working title, we wanted to have a fish in a fish tank, and you wouldnt want to tip the tank, but you can survive longer with more water blocks.
Maybe a bug fix is a better name?
